### Hi there, I am Ishaan ðŸ‘‹

Passionate Software Developer by Day, DJ Extraordinaire by Night - I'm on a Mission to Create Amazing Code and Pump Up the Beats!

With a Knack for Client and Server-Side Scripting in Java, AJAX, Python, and Always on the Hunt for New Languages to Conquer, I'm a Senior at San Jose State University Pursuing a Master's in Software Engineering.

As an Ex-Software Engineering Intern at ServiceNow, I Rocked the Platform Engineering Team with My Contributions to the Automated Testing Framework Tool, Helping Customers Verify Customizations and Enhance the User Experience.

By Leveraging Effective Promise Chains in JavaScript, I Improved Search and Filtering for Records and Reduced Testing Time by 50%. I Also Gained Valuable Experience with REST API, JUnit Tests, Maven, Jenkins, and Kubernetes.

Let's Connect and Create Some Awesome Code - and Who Knows, Maybe Even Spin Some Tracks Together!
