### Hi there, I am Ishaan ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate and performance driven software developer with a knack in client and server-side scripting; proficient in Java, AJAX, Python and always looking for a reason to learn a new language! I am also a senior at San Jose State University pursuing a master's degree in Software Engineering. 

Ex Intern at ServiceNow, worked with the platform engineering team on the Automated testing framework tool, which lets customer test new features on the platform to increase performance and decrease cost.
My role revolved around making the experience better for users by giving meaningful and astute input on new and existing features, one of my major contributions was to improve searching and filtering of records using effective promise chains in JavaScript which led to decrease in testing time by 50% and an overall effect on 5000+ queries every day, other than that I worked on REST API, JUnit tests and got experience with Maven, Jenkings and  Kuberneties.

Fun fact: I am a developer by day and a DJ by night, I play deep house and hard techno at some of the underground clubs around California
